The code I used to cipher my notes is lost, so I could only recover little glimpses of them. I will upload these notes as soon as I get them.

## The nice ones

**Bernard (Innkeeper)**: He risked his life to help us escape from the Spider. He asked us to clear the path so we could run away as well.

## The bad ones

**Spider**: Mob lord controlling the city of _blank_. We owed him, so we ended up as entertainment in his brutal arena. He didn't like when we managed to survive and escape.

**Viktor**: Spider's lieutenant. He was in charge of finding and dispatching us, destroying Bernard's Tavern on the way. He fancies technology and alchemy, using both as tools for murder.

**Alchemist**: This mad gnome was leading the experiments on kobold's blood, finding new elements to enhance his abilities. He is a mastermind on his craft. 

## The ugly ones

**Bonecrusher**: It just hurts looking at him.
