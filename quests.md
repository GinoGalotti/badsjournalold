Unfinished business that we should handle at some point

## Spider

This little bastard put a bounty on our head. He even sent some minions to dispatch us! As soon as we set foot in a safe place, we should make sure he is not going to cause us any more problem. Maybe we should even save the poor souls of _blank_ (name of the place). You can learn more about him [here](https://ginogalotti.github.io/bardsjournal/people/).

## Tavern

Bernard helped us to escape from the Spider, only asking for a safe way out for his family. Instead, we caused his tavern to be completely destroyed. We should go back and check about his safety, and help him run away.

## The Alchemist's bounty

He got our hand on his little bastard and his deviant experiments. Let's bring him back to justice! Or get him (and his brilliant mind) on our side.
