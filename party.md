Do you really think I had enough time to write about you? C'mon. Give me some rest.

I will try to expand on it someday. Probably even today. Nah. Not today.

## Kenneth

My little lizard friend. He is always taking care of us, although I am not really sure about the values of his pantheon... he seems to have a very particular moral compass. 

## Fiona

As mysterious as pretentious. There is not much we know about her past, but there are many jobs that only she can get done. So better to not ask questions! She also prepares the best sandwiches. 

## Kuma

Oh, this little demon. In a moment, he would jump on your face crushing all your teeth in one punch; while on the next second you can see him running away scared because he got a little scratch. He is as unexpected as mighty!

## Bonecrusher

Our big Goliath. Powerful, resilient and colossal. He is always hoping to use his intimidation skills. Remember to speak slowly to him, you don't want to cause any misunderstandings. He tries to find any excuse to sleep next to our patron's spouses.

## Lands

There is not much we know about him. We just know about his dark past, his little flurry glowing fox and his tentacle fetish. I think he is one of those Japanese-obsessed dudes. 

## The rest

Friends come and go. Like the wind. That is life. Do you expect me to remember their names? Fuck no.
