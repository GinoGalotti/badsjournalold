Morning came with the nice surprise of **Fiona** returning to us. Such a lovely eye to open your eyes to. With all that energy, we decided to deal with our most pressing matter first: What to do with this damn Alchemist. 

We discovered that the alchemist leader is where the water leads, and something he is dealing with is causing these earth trembles. There was no point on dispatching this poor little soul, so we decide to carry him with us (at least while his madness is working on the right things!).

**Fiona** decided that a 15 minutes detour was unacceptable, so she climbed down next to the waterfall to go back to the entrance of the cave, while **Lands** thought that it was a brilliant idea to just jump head first to the water! This new genetarion is capable of doing anything to impress a female adventurer...

Water proved to be such a challenging foe, causing us sweat and blood. When we stopped to catch up our breathe, **Kenneth** felt the aura of a powerful artifact laying nearby, so **Bony** charged towards it! He was barely able to dodge those living rocks falling from the ceiling, but in the end we found the source of all that fuzz:

Fohammer (aka Thunder Hammer)

**Bonecrusher** kept that hammer without giving anyone else much of a chance, but we will have time to make a proper decision later on.

From the end of the cave we started hearing growls on top of the continous trembles, but we decided to explore the fluorescent cave before running towards there. There is something so magical about that... light... that we... can't... say... no...

Quote of the day: 
> "Stop complaining, Aclhemist. At least **Bony** got cleaned today". 


Remarks:

* Moving through water is harder than what it seems
* *The Alchemist* seems to be a mad scientist, but not that much of an evil person. He just wants a patreon to keep doing his research. Hopefully we can convince him to put that amazing intellect to good use for the world.
* We learnt that Fiona's stone disease is getting worse, but we have very few leads to follow
* We got our hand on Fohammer, such a powerful artifact. It seems to have current running through it
* The fluorescent cave seems to be the place where another cultist used as a laboratory. He seems to have a special crush on death and the undead.
* Growls and sounds are still coming from the depth of the cave. What is waiting for us there?
