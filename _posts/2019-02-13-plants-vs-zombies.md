Anyone with arcane affinity in the group could sense that there was something deeply wrong on this cave. **Kenneth** used his spells to find someone messing with the aura of prottection coming from the statue we previously fixed. In a rush, we decided to split the group sending **Kenneth**, **Lands** and **Fiona** to deal with whatever happened on that statue, while we ran towards the magic coming from this cave's funghi.

Playing with the fabric of our reality itself (what normal people usually call Casting Spells) semmed to make **Bonecrusher** uneasy, so he decided to engage in combat with some unanimated corpses on the ground. I am happy to announce that he didn't harm himself at all! We are so proud.

Walking inside the cave we found a statue of dwarven craft very similar to the one we studied at the entrance. We stepped closer just to be surprised by a gigantic living elemental made out of plants that was using its tentacles to animate the corpses on the floor, as well as trying to choke us!

While our bodybuilders played with their new floral friend, I majestically convinced the cultist trying to mess with the statue to yield. He explained that these statues offer a protection from evil when they are both active. He disabled that protection to experiment with the undead, but after we activate it again he was overrun by this elemental. We decided to not chop his head yet.

Quote of the day: 
> "We should split up", **Kenneth** famous last words. 

Remarks:

* We decided to split, as someone was messing with both statues protecting us from evil!
* There was much chop chop of plants. *Disclaimer*: No real living thing was harmed in the process of saving the world. The creature seemed to be some kind of aberration. It had tentacles!
* We have a new friend. He seems to get along with the Alchemist, although we have not enough rope for both of them.
* We are one step away of whatever waits for us at the end of this cave!

(WTF were you expecting? I'm a singer, not a writer, JESUS!)
