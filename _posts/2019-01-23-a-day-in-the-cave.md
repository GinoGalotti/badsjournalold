Our journey escaping from the Spider's web was way more challenging than expected. But nothing that I couldn't handle, even if I also had to take care of the rest! We found **Blank name** (_Note: Matt's character_ ) all curled up cozily in a glowy cacoon... sadly we had to wake him up (before the phase spider killed him)! It proved to be a very interesting addition to the group!

He seemed to know how to get out of there, so we shared the journey. After a small bump on the road due to a rock that came into life, we found out that our path was completely blocked! All that trembling caused a section of the tunnel to collapse completely... so we had to take a little detour through the ruins of _Sobern Below_, even if we knew some strange cultist decided to set camp there. Some of our friends stayed clearing the path, so we could finally come out.

Taking the sideway were almost assaulted by **Fiona** and **Lands**, who were following the steps of the Alchemist. There was a hefty bounty on his head! I couldn't trust that pair, but they share with us the details of the bounty and we decided that together we stood a better chance. Some say there is strength on numbers. I personally just feel safer when there are others who can take the punch. Less bruises for me!

We found out these fanatics were studying some poor draconic creatures... which really pissed **Kenneth** off! Those bastards were experimenting with the kobolds, extracting their blood to produce... God knows what! We dispatched those bastards and tried to save the poor little creature, till **Bonecrusher** had a crush on them and started collecting kobold corpses on his belt. 

Following the trail of blood (flasks), we found a vault with many potions and beverages and many items from _Sobern Below_. I have to be honest, it was very disappointing! What kind of ancient Dwarf civilization has NO secret stash of nice ale? Unbelievable. But time was pressing, so we decided to find a way to get in the vault!

With all my expertise and subterfuge, we managed to make them open the door and... here we found The Alchemist! That little bastard, there was no way to establish a coherent conversation with him! And he even had a huge entourage... so inconvenient! I masterfully managed to make him laugh his butt off, while the rest of the guys took care of his minions. 

It was a long exhausting fight, but we managed to tie him up and take him with us. While the madness happened, the entire lab catches up on fire so we had to run deep down the cave. And we were really done after that, that is why we needed a rest after a long eventful day, that is when...

Quote of the day: 
> "Let's camp next to the waterfall, so **Bony** can at least have an indirect shower". 


Remarks:

* Some of us took turns clearing the blocked path... more help is needed!
* We can still feel the trembles coming from somewhere deeper in the cave ( the only direction we can follow)!
* We haven't talked with the Alchemist yet, but we have him well tied up! 
* I really like my shiny dagger. Even if I haven't used it yet.

(WTF were you expecting? I'm a singer, not a writer, JESUS!)
